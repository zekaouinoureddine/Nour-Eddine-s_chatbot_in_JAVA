Yes, This is due to the many technological advances that have taken place in recent years. And this is the reason why I turned in my project, towards the realization of a chatbot that we will see its details later.

My chatbot is written in Java, is intended to answer questions that are asked on the dialog box based on a small database. My chatbot is simple, but adaptive, that is, we can link it to a specific domain, and so help us in this area.
